## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Vouchr is an API that allows you to simulate a Truco (cardgame) match. With POST and GET requests, you can simply create, manage and run a match. <br>
A vouchr match works by rounds and rows. A round is a "deck hand", that is a submatch, divided by 3 or 4 rounds (in case of draw) - The first team to win all the rounds, win a row, recieving a specific pontuation (it can be: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12) determinated during the match. <br> To win a match, the team needs 12 points. <br> The app use the traditional truco card priorities to define the round winner. The cards in growing order are: `4, 5, 6, 7, Q, J, K, A, 2, 3`. <br> In case of two cards have the same value, the card with the major suit will win. The suits in growing order are: `D, S, H, C`.
